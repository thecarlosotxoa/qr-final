# TODOs

## UX/UI Considerations:

### Loading State: Consider adding a loading indicator (e.g., a spinner) when the QR code is being generated to enhance the user experience.
### Clear Button: Add a button to clear the input field and reset the QR code image, which could be helpful after generating a QR code.
### Validation: Add client-side validation for the input to ensure that it's not empty or too short before sending the request.

### If you plan to store QR codes in a database, you might want to store only essential data (like the image URL or the base64 string) to avoid bloating the database.
